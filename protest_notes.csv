"canada s railway passenger system was finally cut by half yesterday, with 18 of 38 routes run by via rail, the government owned passenger service, being eliminated in terms of an earlier decision... as the canadian made its last run to vancouver, where it is to arrive tomorrow, thousands of people gathered at stations along the way to protest against the cuts, which will leave entire regions without services. the train.. carried 539,000 passengers last year but lost millions of dollars. the government announced the passenger service cuts last october, saying they were necessary to trim via s dollars can560 million pounds 280 million annual, taxpayer financed operating subsidy. about 2,700 workers, nearly 40 per cent of the workforce, are to be laid off, saving the government dollars can1.5 billion in subsidies over five years."
"protestors were only identified as young people, and the gathering was spontaneous"
"the queen, after calling on canadians to remain united, braved protesters and entered french speaking quebec yesterday to help celebrate canada s national holiday amid a constitutional crisis. although some quebecers had urged her not to come, the queen strolled around a park in hull, quebec, for half an hour, accompanied by brian mulroney, the federal prime minister, and royal canadian mounted police. about 500 nationalist quebecers, mourning the failure last week of the meech lake accord that would have recognised the province as a distinct society, staged a peaceful protest during the walk. the queen s appearance, part of a special celebration marking canada day, was further dampened by about 500 supporters of the separatist parti quebecois, some of them wrapped in the fleur de lis provincial flag, who staged a vocal but orderly demonstration outside the jacques cartier park in hull, a city of 65,000 located just across the ottawa river from the capital of ottawa."
"canada s federal government has agreed to acquire a tract of land that has been the subject of armed dispute between mohawk indians and officials of a montreal suburb, quebec s minister of indian affairs announced today. at a press conference in montreal, the province s indian affairs minister, john ciaccia, said federal officials had approved the purchase or expropriation if necessary of 55 acres of woodland that mohawks of the kahnesatake community claim as ancestral land. the suburban town of oka, 18 miles west of montreal, planned to use it for an addition to a golf course. ciaccia did not say the land would be recognized as mohawk ancestral territory, but it was clear from his description that the federal action would be intended to block the golf course extension that the indians have been fighting. during the last week and a half of the four month golf course dispute, about 200 mohawks, armed with automatic assault rifles and other weapons, have faced off against hundreds of quebec provincial police. a police officer was shot to death on july 11 when the police tried to remove a barricade erected on the disputed land. it is not clear whether the officer was shot by fellow police or armed indians."
protests were directed against the state due to its refusal to use violence to clear mohawk indians blockades from a main road.
"canadian army troops today fired tear gas into a crowd of about 200 mohawk indians who attempted to block a combined army and quebec police search for illegal weapons on a small island off the kahnawake reservation near montreal. police said a soldier and two mohawks were injured slightly in a melee, and automatic weapons were fired into the air by the troops to disperse the crowd."
"brian mulroney, the embattled conservative prime minister, introduced legislation today to crush a week old strike of federal civil servants that has cut grain shipments, snarled air travel, slowed essential imports and curbed canada s industrial output. two thirds of 156,000 member public service alliance of canada have been on strike since sept. 9. about 46,000 union members are essential personnel prohibited under canadian law from walking off their jobs. the union struck to protest the government s plan to give no pay raises this year and 3 percent hikes in each of the next two years. but the treasury board president, gilles loiselle, insisted today that ottawa was still committed to its previously announced austerity plan."
"the canadian government introduced mandatory back to work legislation today aimed at ending a nationwide strike of federal workers that has disrupted airports and border crossings, stalled grain shipments and closed some offices. following a 10 day truce during which federal employees agreed to work while contract negotiations continued, about 110,000 members of the public service alliance returned to the picket lines to protest the government s wage restraints, which permit no salary increases this year and promise increases of only 3 percent in each of the next two years. the current annual inflation rate is 6 percent."
"rioting was in response to the killing of a black canadian man by police, but was described as inspired by the rodney king riots in los angeles, california."
tens of thousands of canadians marched in the capital today to protest the north american free trade agreement with the united states and mexico. speakers blamed the 1989 canada united states free trade pact for closing canadian industries and throwing hundreds of thousands of people out of work.
"it s barbaric what they re doing, norleen lillico, a shopkeeper, said, arguing against the decision by british columbia s government to allow logging in the formerly protected rain forest on the craggy west coast of vancouver island...ms. lillico, 30, was one of the peaceful protesters arrested last summer for carrying their opposition to the point of refusing to step out of the way of mammoth logging trucks headed into the pristine interior north and west of here. in one of the largest mass arrests in canadian history, nearly 800 were detained, charged with defying a court injunction obtained by macmillan bloedel ltd., the region s biggest logging company. the injunction banned demonstrators from its logging sites."
"last month, 10,000 gun owners and supporters went to parliament hill in ottawa to demonstrate against broader controls. waving banners reading see you on election day, they booed justice minister allan rock when he addressed them. taking a cue from the national rifle association in the united states, canadian gun owners have deluged members of parliament with letters, faxes and telephone calls."
"when 6,000 students marched on ottawa last week they came armed and used their weapons. they tossed raw eggs, orange peels, uncooked macaroni and obscenities at human resources minister lloyd axworthy when he tried to reason with the crowd...the students were protesting increases in university tuition that axworthy is considering...axworthy s proposals are not final, but there seems little doubt that tuitions will rise."
"the 3,000 plus people who rallied here one evening last week wanted to make sure canada s government knew they weren t going to stand for tax increases. even before the meeting began, they waved signs, passed out leaflets and signed petitions opposing new taxes, which many in canada believe the government plans to impose soon. two members of parliament from the governing liberal party who attempted to speak to the group provoked boos, jeers and hisses. no more taxes, thundered the protesters, jumping out of their chairs. go, go, go, they hollered at one of the members who would not promise to vote against any tax increase his prime minister might propose. a wave of grass roots protest has swept through the traditionally complacent canadian electorate, with thousands of citizens warning they will not stand for higher taxes just as the government is preparing a budget that may call for more revenue."
"ontario provincial police fatally shot an indian protester and wounded two others today during a clash at a park near the michigan border that local indians claim is the site of an ancestral burial ground. the incident, which drew hundreds of indians and riot equipped policemen to the scene, was the most violent of a number of conflicts between indians and police all across canada this summer...the incident grew out of an occupation of ipperwash provincial park by a group of about 50 chippewa indians from the kettle and stoney point bands who claim the park was a sacred indian burial ground. ontario police said they fired only after indians driving a school bus and a car crashed through a fence and drove straight at a police detachment, injuring one officer. a spokesman for the protesters told the canadian press that the indians had no weapons and that the bus was in reverse when it was hit by police gunfire...in the aftermath, hundreds of indians converged on the park to join in the occupation, while some tribal leaders sought to negotiate a resolution to the conflict. about 100 police officers surrounded the area last night, and nearby residents were evacuated."
"canadians do not easily take to the streets; it s just not their way. but today thousands of angry people paralyzed parts of canada s largest city to protest government actions that they say threaten the core of what canada stands for. protesters managed to shut down toronto s subway, bus and streetcar system, stranding the 600,000 commuters who normally use public transportation. highways leading to the lester b. pearson international airport were jammed by drivers who deliberately slowed traffic to a crawl. a third of the city s public school teachers did not show up for work, and police officers were needed to keep hundreds of protesters from disrupting the toronto stock exchange. the direct target of the protests was the new provincial government and its leader, mike harris, who has become a darling of wall street by slashing almost 1 billion from ontario s budget, dropping more than 180,000 people from welfare rolls and promising to shrink income taxes 30 percent. eventually the spending cuts will reach nearly 6 billion, but achieving that goal will mean closing hospitals, raising university tuition and laying off civil servants, among other measures. labor unions and community groups wanted to send mr. harris a message that they considered the cuts mean spirited and excessive."
"ontario s 126,000 teachers shut down schools today with a massive walkout aimed at blocking the provincial government s plans to reorganize how canada s largest school system is run. in what could be the most telling in a series of labor actions against the conservative government of premier mike harris, the teachers strike promises to test whether ontarians support his aggressive attack on the province s budget deficit or feel he has moved too quickly and cut too deeply into social, health and education programs...throughout the province, teachers picketed in snow and chill winds, closing schools to classes and after school community events."
"canada s 45,000 striking postal workers said today that they would obey legislation forcing them to return to work, but would deliver the mail without checking that the proper postage had been paid. the house of commons passed a bill this week to force the postal employees to resume work by friday and end a strike that began on nov. 19."
"hundreds of french speaking youths disrupted a youth conference yesterday organized by separatists in quebec city. on tuesday night some 2,000 protesters hurled snowballs and molotov cocktails at the police, injuring a policeman. many young people complain that provincial politicians spend too much time pursuing political autonomy while under financed high schools have some of the highest dropout rates in north america."
"this protest followed multiple deaths of young indian men who were picked up by police when drunk and dropped in fields in the middle of winter and subsequently froze to death. over the weekend, 400 people about half of them white, half of them indian participated in a candlelight march of protest and solidarity through town to police headquarters."
"with other opinion polls indicating that canadians view health care as the nation s top issue, ralph klein, the popular premier of alberta, unveiled a bill in march that americans might consider cautious. after a preamble outlawing private hospitals, the bill goes on to allow overnight stays in surgical clinics. it is touching the so called third rail; it is opening up the debate on health care, mr. klein, a conservative, said on tuesday as he wearily prepared for an eighth night of protesters outside the legislature, chanting kill the bill. under the bill, expected to be passed on may 11, the government would reimburse private clinics for performing the same surgeries performed in government hospitals. at a rally tuesday night, attended by about 500 people, there were two common themes: that canada s socialized medical system had faltered because conservative governments had starved it of cash, and that private surgical clinics would open the door for the americanization of canadian health care."
"anti poverty protesters fought with the police outside the ontario legislature in toronto. several people were injured and at least three were arrested. protesting the austerity policies of ontario s conservative government, demonstrators, some obscuring their faces with bandannas, gas masks or helmets, attacked the police with rocks, bricks and paint bombs. the police responded with pepper spray and horseback charges."
"the canadian flags that fly above the crab boats have been hoisted upside down, and some are defaced with swastikas. graffiti compares the federal fisheries minister to saddam hussein. four large fishing boats are smoldering snarls of metal engines and wooden hulls, and a processing plant and a government warehouse are charred wrecks. the ruins are the work of 250 crab fishermen who went on a rampage on may 3 to protest a sudden change in federal policy that transferred some of their crab quotas to neighboring lobstermen and to an indigenous group. the rebellion is seen here as something akin to the boston tea party, against a heavy handed government in ottawa. now the shippagan crab fishermen are refusing to leave port and threaten to boycott the entire two month season that was to begin this week. processing plants in the region are shutting down, throwing thousands of people out of work as far away as the gaspe peninsula in quebec and putting 90 million in snow crab exports in jeopardy."
the scene on fashionable rue st. denis looked as if it came out of another era: hundreds of students staging a sit in in front of a liberal party office and blocking rush hour traffic on a tuesday afternoon. red and black banners flapped as fists pumped in the air. the police surrounded the students in their patrol cars. drivers appeared to patiently accept their inconvenience by not honking. people enjoying the dazzling spring afternoon at outdoor cafes clapped and joined in the chants of protest against cuts in student aid.
"a proposal to allow canadians to use muslim religious law, or sharia, to settle family disputes has provoked protests near and far... homa arjomand, who organised a protest that attracted about 300 people in toronto, said: the rise of sharia in canada...is a threat. women s rights are not negotiable and we will not tolerate the interference of religion in our justice system. ontario has allowed catholic and jewish faith based tribunals to settle family law matters on a voluntary basis since 1991. the practice drew little attention until muslim leaders demanded the same rights. canadian politicians must decide whether to exclude one religion or to scrap the religion based family courts altogether."
"the police in southwestern ontario stormed a group of native canadian protesters to end a standoff that began feb. 28 over a land claim. the police detained 16 protesters but retreated when about 75 more people showed up in response to the raid. by midmorning, hundreds of people from as far away as manitoba arrived to bolster the protest, which has halted construction of a housing development. police action against native canadians has been a delicate issue in ontario since 1995, when a protester was killed by a police sniper."
"canadian travelers faced road closings and rail shutdowns on friday as they set out for the canada day holiday weekend during nationwide protests by native groups against the conservative government over several recent disputes about land claims and financing...most demonstrations on friday, however, mirrored a peaceful march of about 1,000 people past the parliament buildings in ottawa that was led by phil fontaine, the national chief of the assembly of first nations, the main native group."
"three police officers were injured, one shot in the leg, during rioting in montreal that erupted late sunday in response to the killing of an 18 year old by the police the day before. a fire station, fire trucks, cars and about 20 shops were vandalized or set ablaze. an ambulance worker was also injured. about 500 riot police officers quelled the violence."
the protesters demanded that the canadian government apply pressure through sanctions on the sri lankan government to cease violence against tamil civilians.
"protesters hurled eggs and chanted majesty go home as the prince of wales and the duchess of cornwall ventured into the french speaking canadian province of quebec. about 200 separatists scuffled with riot police on tuesday night as they confronted the royal couple, who were visiting the montreal headquarters of the black watch royal highland regiment of canada, which the prince formally commands...the demonstration was organised by the qu becois network of resistance."
the protests were against canada s decision to host the olympic games.
"a crowd of about 300 protesters staged the noisiest demonstration of the duke and duchess of cambridge s tour of canada yesterday as the couple attended a military ceremony in quebec. blowing horns, whistles and vuvuzelas and shouting anti royal slogans, they were kept a safe distance from the duke and duchess by a squad of riot police. we have nothing against them, said julien gaudreau, a spokesman for the separatist movement, the resistance network of quebec. they are a sweet couple. they can be in love all they want. but more than 70 per cent of the population of quebec want to get rid of the monarchy."
protests were part of a long student strike against the quebec government s plan to raise tuition by 75 percent
"in a rare display of political unrest, protesters clashed today with the police and government supporters on the havana waterfront and in the hotel zone after a series of boat hijackings by people trying to flee cuba. responding to the riots, president fidel castro threatened to let cubans leave without restriction for the first time since the mariel boat exodus of 1980, which brought a flood of refugees to the united states. mr. castro said that unless the united states stops encouraging people to flee cuba by sea, we will stop blocking the departure of those who want to leave the country. the riot began after troops and police tried to break up a crowd at the port waiting for a ferry that makes the regular ten minute trip across havana bay, in the hope that it might be hijacked to miami. last week at least three ferries were hijacked. as the authorities moved in, hundreds of anti government protesters charged down the seafront shouting libertad! freedom . thirty five people, including ten policemen, were injured, the newspaper juventud rebelde said. yesterday police and communist party militants were guarding the waterfront. and thousands of angry cubans gathered in havana on thursday and friday, some to taunt government security forces and chant down with fidel."
"cuban opposition activists held a defiant public meeting today punctuated by cries of libertad! and emotional testimony from relatives of political prisoners. at a havana house where six protesters are fasting, about 50 people gathered to denounce fidel castro s government for the jailing of dissidents and to charge rights abuses. the six have been fasting for a week, taking liquids but not solid foods. we are already a bit weak, but spiritually strong, said one of the protesters, oscar elias biscet, who heads a small, militant opposition group called the lawton foundation. this fast is to demand that castro s communist government respect human rights and free all the political prisoners. the cuban people demand justice, demand freedom."
"nuns cry at the funeral in havana of oswaldo paya, the leading political activist who died in a car crash that some claim was orchestrated by the castro regime hannah strange writes . about 50 anti government activists, including the journalist and hunger striker guillermo farinas, were arrested by police on tuesday after emerging from the church shouting freedom! and slogans against the communist leadership."
"though the protests began with student demonstrations, they quickly became widespread throughout the haitian population."
"political and labor leaders called today for a general strike on wednesday to protest the return from exile of the former leader of the brutal paramilitary force built by the duvalier family to maintain its 30 year dictatorship. as minister of the interior and defense under jean claude duvalier, the returned exile, roger lafontant, is considered to have been the force behind the tontons macoute, the paramilitary group with a long record of using terror to derail democratic change in haiti. the duvalier family dictatorship was ousted in 1986."
"life is slowly returning to normal in port au prince, the capital, after the military coup that overthrew president jean bertrand aristide on sept. 30, but in this small town a smoldering test of nerves between the army and a defiant population continues. even as military reinforcements arrive from the capital to hold this isolated region, a cradle of the leftist liberation theology that helped thrust father aristide forward as a leader in the fight against the duvalier dictatorship, poor residents angrily vow never to submit to the army. to avoid the soldiers bullets, they say, they sleep in the bush at night. in port au prince, soldiers shooting into crowds quickly put down demonstrations against the coup, but here thousands of residents filled the streets, shouting angrily and destroying buildings belonging to people believed to have links with the army."
"while much of haiti seems to have lapsed into a sort of dejected resignation over father aristide s overthrow by the army, gonaives s 80,000 residents boast of a long tradition of resistance and say they are willing to endure anything to restore their leader. in what many said recalled the start of a series of popular demonstrations that began here in 1985 and ultimately led to the uprooting of the duvalier family dictatorship in 1986, 300 to 400 youths ended a week of silent protests and prayer in gonaives on friday with the nation s first march to demonstrate against father aristide s overthrow."
"police officers stormed a university auditorium today and arrested about 80 students who were protesting the ouster of president jean bertrand aristide, witnesses said. at least four of the students were beaten, the witnesses said. about 10 haitian journalists covering the protest were detained by the police, but all were released later."
"the bush administration yesterday urged all factions in haiti s political crisis particularly the military to adhere to an agreement reached late sunday that would eventually return deposed president jean bertrand aristide to power. the agreement, worked out in negotiations at the organization of american states here between aristide and leaders of haiti s national assembly, would install a new prime minister, grant amnesty to those involved in last september s bloody coup and retain lt. gen. raoul cedras as top military commander...about 200 anti aristide demonstrators protested outside the haitian parliament yesterday carrying placards denouncing the oas agreement. demonstration organizer vladimir jeanty predicted the lawmakers who signed the agreement including senate president dejean belizaire, a coup supporter, and alexandre medard, president of the legislature would be arrested when they attempted to return to haiti today."
"haitian police, firing automatic weapons, yesterday attacked and arrested participants in a street protest by 200 students testing prime minister marc bazin s promise to end human rights abuses. witnesses said several students were hit by bullets. a haitian journalist said police used clubs to beat many students and arrested at least 50. the attack took place in the capital s medical faculty, to which the demonstrators returned after marching through nearby streets chanting slogans calling for the return of ousted president jean bertrand aristide."
"a funeral mass today for victims of last week s ferry disaster turned into the largest demonstration in support of the rev. jean bertrand aristide since he was was overthrown as president in september 1991. about 2,500 people attended the two hour service for the 600 to 900 people who perished when the ferry neptune sank on feb. 16. at least a dozen times, people chanted aristide or death! representatives of the military backed government did not attend. despite efforts by the head of a united nations human rights mission to maintain calm, several demonstrators were arrested outside the cathedral after scuffling with bystanders shouting anti aristide slogans."
"for the first time since a september 1991 military coup ousted president jean bertrand aristide, the haitian military and the police today allowed supporters of the exiled president to march in the capital. watched by six observers from the united nations and organization of american states, a group of 10 roman catholic priests led 300 people in a religious procession with political overtones for some 500 yards...the marchers sang hymns and recited prayers most of the way, but at the end of the procession, about a third of the participants broke into chants of aristide or death! while activists scattered leaflets calling for his return. no uniformed soldiers or police were visible at any time."

"america s military intervention in haiti looked increasingly hazardous last night as tensions erupted in port au prince and jean bertrand aristide, haiti s exiled president, refused to endorse president clinton s deal with the military regime that overthrew him. one man died in the haitian capital and several others were injured when police using clubs and teargas broke up a demonstration by thousands of aristide supporters near one of the city s worst slums. one of those wounded was reported to be a haitian policeman. american troops were clearly frustrated that their rules of engagement did not allow them to intervene in the repeated clashes between haitian armed forces and backers of the deposed president. mr aristide s supporters threw stones at the soldiers throughout the day, provoking more than half a dozen attacks with batons and teargas."
"us army spokesman col. barry willey said that saturday in the city of gonaives, 60 miles north of the capital, about 10,000 supporters of aristide gathered outside the army headquarters. he said two men, armed with m 1 rifles, displayed hostile intent toward american soldiers and were disarmed. after the disarming, he said, the crowd surged forward and attacked the two, who ended up being rescued by u.s. troops and escorted from the area."

"emboldened by government concessions to peasant rebels here in chiapas state, thousands of mexicans marched through towns across central and southern mexico this week, declaring solidarity with the rebels and threatening similar revolts unless president carlos salinas de gortari also pays attention to their needs. in puebla state on tuesday, 3,000 people marched through the town of tehuitzingo and announced formation of the zapatista movement of the south. the protesters denounced what they called the lack of democracy in mexico and asked leaders of the rebel zapatista national liberation army to present their demands to government negotiator manuel camacho solis when face to face peace talks are convened in the next few days."

"as president ernesto zedillo struggled to convince a skeptical u.s. congress of mexico s economic and political stability, militants of his ruling party virtually closed down this oil rich southern capital city today in a bold act of defiance. the protest marked an unusually public display of discord within zedillo s institutional revolutionary party known by its spanish initials, pri as the president appeals for political and economic sacrifice to combat the effects of a recent currency devaluation. club wielding protesters used cargo trucks, buses and passenger vehicles to block dozens of highways and back roads into villahermosa, a city of 350,000. similar blockades were reported in at least nine other towns here in tabasco state, virtually isolating it from the rest of the country and bringing interstate commerce to a halt."

"defying the pro government union leaders who have dominated mexican labor since the 1930 s, independent unions and leftist political groups turned the celebration of labor day today into an outpouring of anger at the economic policies of president ernesto zedillo. the limited political strength of the independent labor movement was evident in the colonial central square of this capital, where the biggest of more than a dozen protests around the country drew only about one fifth of the 350,000 demonstrators that organizers had predicted. but for the first time in decades, may day s main political act was something other than a loyal tribute to the government and its long ruling institutional revolutionary party."
"law enforcement officials who feared that economic austerity measures enacted here would spawn crime and social unrest say that the long, hot summer they dreaded has descended on mexico with a vengeance. even though president ernesto zedillo asserted in his state of the nation speech last week that the worst of mexico s nine month economic crisis is over, top administration officials acknowledge that they now are paying the price for sharp government cutbacks adopted as part of a national recovery plan. over the past two weeks, riot police have clashed daily with protesters in the streets of mexico city, while crime figures are skyrocketing nationwide."

"The leftist president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, has managed to bring together world leaders of all stripes in a rare show of unity against his ouster Sunday.But he has also left this Central American nation as polarized as ever - and the signs of division abound all over the capital city, in graffiti splashed across walls and streets snarled by ad hoc protests.At a march in favor of Mr. Zelaya Wednesday, where protesters blocked off streets with large rocks and screamed We want Mel, - their nickname for Zelaya - Mari Cruz Amador, a school teacher, says her wish is simple: We want our elected president, not the president who put himself as president.As they marched by, Rolando Salgado, a vendor of construction products, shook his head. Manuel Zelaya cannot come back as president because he broke the law, he says. The person responsible for all of this tragedy is Manuel Zelaya.Critics of Zelaya, who was arrested early Sunday morning and sent to Costa Rica, say he was pushed out in the name of democracy after forging forward with his bid to let presidents seek re-election beyond a single four-year term, despite widespread rejection of the move that even the Supreme Court deemed illegal. Those supporting Zelaya, however, say they will stay on the streets until their president has been reinstated. The result is an increasingly tense standoff that shows no signs of abating.Honduras, one of the poorest nations in the region, has long been divided along the same class lines that characterize most of Latin America. The elite have historically had a tight grip on the political scene, but Zelaya vowed to empower the poor, raising salaries and supporting single mothers. He is the only person generating change in this country, says Angel Castro, a hospital administrator in Tegucigalpa. But many say he become too closely aligned with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and other leftist leaders, particularly in his bid to change the Constitution to allow presidents to run for more than one term, and it ultimately cost him control - at least for now - of his country.Many Zelaya supporters, who tend to lean to the left and come from the poorer segments of society, say they find themselves in the rare position of being supported by such unlikely characters as leaders from the US, which has condemned Zelaya's ouster. I am thankful to the world, that they are supporting our country so that we have a good democracy, says Ms. Cruz.Many Hondurans against Zelaya, however, say they are both surprised, and dismayed, that the world has not come to their side. Mario Cruz, a manager for an auto parts company, says that he just returned from a trip to France, Germany, and Mexico, and says it is clear that the world is against his country's new leadership. But they do not understand what is going on here, he says. Zelaya is not the person he is presenting himself to be to the world.It has been four days since Hondurans awoke Sunday morning to find that instead of voting in a nonbinding referendum to consider drawing up a constituent assembly, their president no longer was in power.Since then, curfews have been put in place. Warring street protests have clogged the streets. Anger is palpable.As two soldiers walked toward the pro-Zelaya march Wednesday, protesters rushed at them screaming, Soldiers, get out of here! They toppled the stands where newspapers, which heavily favor the new government, are sold, placing them in the middle of the road as barricades.When will Zelaya return?Zelaya has pledged that he will return to Honduras possibly as early as the weekend to retake power - a plan backed by the Organization of American States.The coup leaders vow that he will be arrested on multiple charges for breaking the law.Tensions could remain high for days, and possibly weeks. But Ricardo Calix, a gas attendant, says he is hopeful that unity will find its way to Honduras. He does not agree with Zelaya nor the protesters. But they are my neighbors, he says. We will have to move on."

"thousands of peruvians across the country marched against president alberto fujimori s bid for reelection to a third term, in a national day of protest that paralyzed some areas and left at least one person injured by gunfire. labor unions, teachers, students and people from all walks of life took to the streets in several cities to voice discontent with fujimori s attempt to prolong his 10 year rule that some consider heavy handed enough to brand a dictatorship."
"four demonstrators and two police officers were injured in a protest thursday over alleged election fraud by peru s president alberto fujimori, who is running for re election. the protesters tried to storm an office of fujimore s rightist alliance peru 2000 party in the city of iquitos, news reports said."
in response to a call for civil disobedience
"with president alberto fujimori virtually guaranteed victory in a runoff election today that was boycotted by the opposition and condemned by international observers, peruvians showed just how polarized they have become over the deeply divisive presidential race. in contrast to the relatively peaceful first round vote on april 9, angry protesters loyal to alejandro toledo, fujimori s chief rival, clashed repeatedly with peruvian security forces. massive demonstrations and riots rocked cities across the nation tonight, starting this morning as police enforcing prohibitions against political acts during voter hours used tear gas and water cannons to keep rock throwing protesters from entering plazas in downtown lima. tensions mounted after the polls closed as thousands more protesters answered a call from toledo for even larger rallies, many of which turned violent this evening despite his request that the demonstrations remain peaceful."
"peruvian president alberto fujimori named an obscure opposition presidential candidate as his prime minister today as his opposition launched a three day march on the capital to block his inauguration friday...the announcements appeared to aim at taking the wind out of the protests, which the opposition has said will peak friday with hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in the streets to disrupt fujimori s swearing in for a third five year term. the first of the series of planned demonstrations took shape this evening, when several thousand laborers gathered in lima s main plaza outside the gates of the national palace. they chanted, democracy, yes; dictatorship, no, and waved banners, but there was no confrontation with security forces."
"more than 40,000 flag waving peruvians chanting down with the dictatorship! gathered at a rally in central lima yesterday to protest the swearing in of president alberto fujimori for a third term. a central square in the colonial centre was filled with demonstrators from the andes, the jungle and pacific coast in a protest that will culminate outside congress today when fujimori takes office. marchers, some with gas masks, many with flags and nearly all chanting anti fujimori slogans, streamed in from each corner of the square in a protest called the march of the four suyos named after the cardinal points of the inca empire."
"tens of thousands of protesters converged friday in downtown lima for the swearing in of peruvian president alberto fujimori for an unprecedented third five year term. the opposition supporting former candidate alejandro toledo said 200,000 protesters would maintain a vigil friday when fujimori took his oath of office. it is calling for the re establishment of constitutional order and a new election without the incumbent."
"the colonial heart of lima turned into a battlefield today when several thousand pro democracy demonstrators set three government buildings on fire killing at least six people and clashed with military police in a day of angry protest over president alberto fujimori s inauguration for an unprecedented third term. although the protests, largely contained to several square blocks in the city center, were surprisingly violent, they involved a smaller number of demonstrators than organizers had hoped. a core group of 4,000 to 8,000 students and trade unionists loyal to opposition leader alejandro toledo skirmished with police throughout the day. fire officials confirmed that six were dead from the fires set in the center of the city. at least 100 were injured as police cracked down with massive clouds of tear gas and armored water cannons. air force jets and army helicopters flew low over protesters in what opponents called scare tactics."
"about 300 inmates rioted monday at a prison in southern peru, following the death of a prisoner under murky circumstances, prison officials said. guards were able to control the situation and eventually persuaded the inmates to calm down. the prisoners were roiled by allegations that the inmate, who died the day before, had fallen victim to physical abuse by guards. officials at peru s san antonio de pocollay prison, located near the chilean border, have denied any wrongdoing."
hunger strike 300
"about 300 demonstrators interrupted scheduled flights at the international airport in cuzco, in southern peru, tuesday in an act a top official in president alejandro toledo s government branded as criminal. angry demonstrators took over the runway and buildings at alejandro velasco astete airport, which serves peru s top tourist site, the inca ruins of machu picchu, at around 7:30 am 1230 gmt , demanding toledo pave local roads and build a new road from cuzco to quillabamba in the eastern part of the province."
"some 1,200 prisoners of the el milagro jail in trujillo in northern peru staged riots on friday, demanding the dismissal of the jail s director jose moreno whom the prisoners accuse of tolerating abuses and mistreating visitors. the protest grew more radical hours later and more inmates from another section of the jail joined the rioting after dialogues with the penitentiary authorities failed. the prisoners also protested against the lack of shops and demanded adequate medical care."

"thousands of peruvians poured into an andean city on tuesday to stage new protests a day after a mob enraged by corruption killed their mayor, took three city officials hostage and attacked a police station to free three protest leaders. peru s interior minister fernando rospigliosi warned protests by indigenous aymara people in the city of ilave were getting out of control. there is no way to control a mob, there is no way; there is a commission on the scene that is going to try to meet with protest leaders, said the minister. we would have to use a great deal of violence to regain control at this time."
"protests sparked by the lynching of a town mayor spread across peru, as miners struck and coca growers marched on lima, where president alejandro toledo faced the third national uprising of his term...the murder of ilave mayor cirilo robles is the tip of the iceberg, said david jimenez, the head of puno province, where the mayor was killed. indeed, on thursday, 200 aymaras took hostage five city council members of the nearby town of tilali, because the mayor, whom they said is corrupt, was nowhere to be found. thousands of residents had blocked roads into ilave since april 2, demanding the mayor resign after corruption allegations. they blamed lima, 1,300 kilometers 800 miles to the north, for ignoring the problem."

"some 250 chilean youths chanting laguna del desierto is chilean protested outside the government palace wednesday over a court ruling granting a disputed piece of land to neighboring argentina. a latin american court in rio de janeiro, brazil, ruled last week with a 3 2 vote that the 210 square mile 530 sq km tract in patagonia, near the southern tip of south america, belonged to argentina. the youths, linked to chile s rightist independent democratic union party, also marched on the argentine embassy in santiago, but police blocked their access to the embassy and the government palace. the protesters then marched on the foreign ministry building. the chilean government has accepted the ruling on the laguna del desierto, which was the subject of one of several outstanding land disputes between argentina and chile. the two south american nations had agreed to take the matter to independent arbitration and respect the decision, whatever the outcome."

"thousands of chilean farmers took to the streets to protest the government s agricultural policies wednesday, saying economic liberalization is taking its toll on their pocketbooks. the farmers, many of them holding placards denouncing the proposed integration of chile into the north american free trade agreement nafta , demanded solutions from chilean president eduardo frei. chile has made a bid to join nafta, and has been talking to treaty s three signatories canada, the united states and mexico. organizers hoped to draw some 30,000 demonstrators, which would have made the rally the largest since before the military regime that ruled from 1973 to 1990. there was no official estimate of the number of demonstrators."
"the government demanded an explanation monday from former dictator gen. augusto pinochet after army officers staged a show of support for a colleague jailed for a political assassination in the united states. the officers, accompanied by their families, gathered saturday near a jail north of santiago, where brig. pedro espinosa serves a six year sentence for the 1976 assassination in washington, d.c., of orlando letelier. espinoza, chief of the secret police during pinochet s 1973 90 dictatorship, was jailed a month ago. interior minister carlos figueroa said the demonstration worried the government because the number of participants showed that there was a previous coordination among the officers."

"chile s paramilitary police used water cannon and tear gas to fend off about 5,000 students, some hurling rocks and homemade firebombs, trying to march to the presidential palace. at least 33 students were arrested during the disturbances on wednesday, police said. the violent clashes capped a tense day which began when about 500 striking coal miners converged on the presidential palace, known as la moneda, after traveling from the impoverished lota region 550 kilometers 341 miles south of the capital. the disturbance occurred when military police prevented the column of demonstrating students from the presidential palace, where the estimated 500 miners had a rally earlier in the day. the student protest was called by groups opposing president eduardo frei s proposals to change the way 19 state run universities are run."
"some 300 striking coal miners took to the streets of santiago sunday as chile s government and the state owned mining company attempted to end the 26 day work stoppage. the miners, who traveled from the town of lota about 550 kilometers 330 miles south of the capital, were demanding that 97 laid off workers be rehired. the lota mining operation is losing about 27 million dollars per year."
"police cracked down on about 100 striking coal miners protesting outside chile s presidential palace friday, making eight arrests, witnesses said. one protestor was slightly hurt in the clash which marked the first outbreak of violence tied to the strike by the miners from the town of lota about 550 kilometers 330 miles south of the capital. they have been on strike for 31 days demanding that 97 laid off workers be rehired. in the city of concepcion, not far from the lota mine, another group of protestors briefly seized the consulate of italy in a symbolic gesture as president presidente eduardo frei visits that country. dozens of women and children who are family members of striking miners marched through the streets of concepcion peacefully."
"about 5,000 santiago residents rallied wednesday to protest the continued high levels of smog in their city of 5.3 million people and demand stronger measures from the government. the citizens front for clean air, a loose alliance of environmentalist groups, organized the event at a park near santiago. many protesters wore masks and held signs demanding clean air. thousands of drivers also joined the effort, turning off their engines at 6 p.m. as a symbolic contribution to clean air. santiago suffers from severe pollution, especially during the winter season from july through august. a variety of government programs to curb have proved insufficient. earlier this week, president eduardo frei announced a dlrs 1.6 million investment over the next five years to improve the nation s transportation system, including new streets in major cities, extensions of subway lines and improving public bus service."

"police used tear gas and water cannon to prevent some 800 protesting miners from reaching the downtown government headquarters monday. the miners were angry at the government s decision to close lota, a coal mine 500 kilometers 310 miles south of santiago. santiago. the morning protest turned violent when miners threw stones at police and vehicles near the main downtown plaza. police lobbed tear gas inside a downtown union building to evict some 30 workers who took refuge there...the miners, who travelled by train to santiago for the protest, claim their severance packages are insufficient. some 2,100 miners lost their jobs when president eduardo frei closed the 146 year old mine, a historic hotbed of chilean union activity, on april 17. protests began almost immediately."

"returning to the site where an act of desperation by a humble tunisian fruit seller triggered revolution across the middle east, president marzouki, apparently expected a warmer reception. instead his photoshoot in the town of sidi bouzid, the birthplace of the arab spring, backfired spectacularly. the president had to flee after being pelted with rocks by furious protesters disillusioned with that revolution, which began two years ago yesterday. the crowd of about 3,000 people booed mr marzouki, demanding jobs and voicing their frustration at the uprising s failure to bring tangible improvements to their daily lives."

"when police flooded the tunisian city of kairouan yesterday to block a rally by hardline salafi muslims, a few hundred diehards shifted to a neighborhood mosque, where they locked themselves inside and marched about, crying god is great! even in their defeat, some saw victory. the government won t let them have their meeting, so they re having it here in the house of god, said one of the demonstrators, who gave only a nom de guerre: abdallah servant of god . many of them had come from other towns and were staying at the mosque. the government effort to quash yesterday s rally shows new zeal by tunisia s leaders to defy the country s increasingly assertive salafi movement. but smaller gatherings and rioting elsewhere suggest that in the long run, that movement won t back down. as security forces clamped down on kairouan, a medieval city south of tunis, salafi demonstrations erupted in the capital, spiraling into clashes between police and locals that left at least one young man dead."

"in tehran s largestanti u.s. rally in years, tensof thousands of demonstrators joined monday in chants of death to america as hard liners directed a major show of resolve against president hassan rouhani s outreach to washington more than a generation after crowds on the same streets stormed and occupied the u.s. embassy. such america bashing protests occur every year outside the former embassy compound to mark the anniversary of the 1979 takeover after the islamic revolution. but the latest demonstration had a dual purpose of sending the boldest warning yet to rouhani s government over whether it can expand dialogue with the united states or offer the concessions needed to settle the nuclear impasse with the west."

"about 75 christians and others assembled in baghdad to demand the reinstatement of a provision of the provincial elections law, which ensures political representation of minority groups. the provision allows for council seats for christians and two other minority groups. its elimination was the most significant political development for christians since american troops overthrew saddam hussein in 2003."

"tens of thousands of sunni muslims blocked iraq s main trade route to neighboring syria and jordan in a demonstration on wednesday against prime minister nuri kamal al maliki, a shiite. the size of the protests in the sunni stronghold of anbar province was an escalation in protests that erupted last week after troops detained the bodyguards of finance minister rafe al essawi, a sunni. the move against mr. essawi s guards came hours after president jalal talabani, a kurd who has mediated among sunni, shiite and kurdish factions, left the country for treatment in germany after a stroke that could end his steadying influence over iraqi politics."
"a political crisis facing the shiite led government of prime minister nuri kamal al maliki of iraq appeared to escalate on friday, as more political rivals called for his resignation and for early elections. in addition to the political arena, demand for change echoed in the streets as demonstrators expanded protests in major iraqi cities."

"at least seven protesters and two soldiers were killed friday in clashes that started after iraqi army forces opened fire on demonstrators who had pelted them with rocks on the outskirts of falluja, west of baghdad. it was the first deadly confrontation in more than a month of antigovernment protests by mostly sunni opponents of prime minister nuri kamal al maliki."

"at least 20 people were killed late tuesday night and wednesday in shootouts between security forces and extremists in cairo and aswan. in the wake of allegations that islamic extremists in egypt may be connected to the bombing of the world trade center in new york last month, experts say both the extremists and the egyptian government may be flexing their muscles before the international community. there is an escalation of violence, which has assumed an enormous proportion, because of action and reaction, says mo hammed sayed ahmed, an egyptian journalist. the shootout occurred when muslim militants tried to mount a protest march tuesday in the southern tourist city of aswan. seven islamists were killed and 15 people injured, including two policemen."

"the killing of sheik ahmed yassin on monday triggered a widespread and angry wave of condemnation from europe and the arab world, both of which contended the attack was an illegal act that would make the search for middle east peace and the fight against terrorism more difficult.... about 7,000 students demonstrated at cairo s al azhar university, where yassin studied."
"this case was the protest in beheira: muslim christian relations in egypt burst onto the public stage last week after allegations by coptic christians of forced conversion to islam triggered demonstrations in cairo. sectarian friction was also reported in provinces of upper egypt... on dec. 5 and 6, longstanding resentment exploded as hundreds of coptic christians, egypt s largest christian denomination, staged angry protests in cairo and in the west delta province of beheira. the demonstrations were sparked by the alleged abduction and forced conversion to islam of the wife of a coptic priest. protestors, gathering at a coptic cathedral in the cairo district of abbasiya demanded the return of the woman in question, wefaa constantine, to church authorities. demonstrators also protested against what many christians perceive as an unofficial discrimination policy."

"in front of the gates of cairo university last month, a disparate crowd of about 500 islamists, nasserists, secularists and activist pacifists calling itself the egyptian movement for change demonstrated noisily before journalists and a surprisingly benign police force in 30 armored vehicles. the purpose of the protest was to bring pressure on president hosni mubarak. according to the egyptian weekly al ahram, one activist leader screamed out words like poverty, torture, corruption, to which the crowd responded by shouting back one word: kifaya!"
"president hosni mubarak s statement last month that egypt s next election will involve multiple candidates instead of being simply a referendum on his rule unleashed a rush of opposition activity here. demonstrations by largely secular and left wing groups have become commonplace, as have press attacks on the president and his family. but sunday, with the outlawed but politically powerful muslim brotherhood set to join the fray, the regime sent a clear signal on the limits of dissent."

"thousands of riot police officers sealed off access to the high court on thursday, beating and arresting protesters who had turned out to support two judges facing a disciplinary panel because they had accused the government of election fraud. the huge show of force, appearing larger even than what was deployed in the sinai after four bombings there this week, seemed to signal that president hosni mubarak sgovernment had reached a breaking point over shows of dissent. the focus was a relatively small demonstration over the treatment of the two judges and in support of more than 80 others who had been staging a sit in for more than a week at the stately old judges club to demand an independent judiciary."
president hosni mubarak s government dispatched thousands of riot police officers into the center of the city on thursday to silence demonstrators intent on showing support for judges demanding independence from the president. the police clubbed men and women trying to demonstrate as well as half a dozen journalists.

"day after day, hundreds of workers from all over egypt have staged demonstrations and sit ins outside parliament, turning sidewalks in the heart of the capital into makeshift camps and confounding government efforts to bring an end to the protests. nearly every day since february, protesters have chanted demands outside parliament during daylight and laid out bedrolls along the pavement at night. the government and its allies have been unable to silence the workers, who are angry about a range of issues, including low salaries."

"more than three months after hosni mubarak was ousted from presidency, tens of thousands of egyptians converged on tahrir square for what some are calling a second revolution. while they have ousted their dictator, many are impatient with the pace of change under egypt s interim military rulers and see a need for steady pressure. the protesters called on the military council now ruling egypt to end the practice of sending civilians to military trials, to expedite legal action against former president hosni mubarak and his associates, and to start governing with some civilian presidential council."

"the attacks by the army, and the state media coverage of them, appeared to many observers to be a direct attempt to incite fighting between christians and muslims in egypt. they raised sharp questions about the role of the supreme council of the armed forces, the military council currently ruling egypt, and its stated intention of guiding egypt through a transition to democracy. some say it is provoking the violence as a pretext for staying in power, or at least preserving the privileges and independence of the military. why does the army and the government kill us? asked boula zakie, tears streaming down his face and onto his black shirt as he sat in the coptic hospital and watched his friend being carried past on a stretcher amid the din of wailing. we feel we are not from this country anymore. i feel this country is going to be islamic. the army is the one who shoots the christian people, and says to the muslims, here, take your country now. and they forget we are the ones who were here first. egypt s finance minister resigned tuesday in protest over the killing of two dozen unarmed coptic christian protesters by the security forces, as reverberations from the outburst of violence two days ago continued to shake egypt s interim government."

"they came in their tens of thousands rich, poor, old, young, christian and muslim to pay their final respects to rafik hariri, the billionaire sunni muslim politician whose death on monday in a bomb explosion stunned a nation. with lebanese government officials staying away, mr hariri s funeral became as much an angry protest against syria s pervasive influence over lebanon as it was a symbol of national grief and unity across the sectarian divide. yelling anti syrian slogans, a heaving sea of mourners accompanied the funeral cortege of black limousines and ambulances carrying the remains of mr hariri and the seven bodyguards who also died in the blast. led by a line of whiteturbaned sunni muslim clerics, their arms interlocked, the procession slowly wound through beirut s packed streets from mr hariri s home to the mohammed al amine mosque in the city centre. the 200,000 strong crowd was the biggest gathering that lebanon had seen since a mass given by pope john paul ii in 1997."

"it s politics as usual in lebanon, more than two months after hundreds of thousands of flag waving lebanese poured into downtown beirut this spring, furious over the assassination feb. 14 of the former lebanese prime minister, rafiq hariri, which they blamed on syria. in what they proclaimed the cedar revolution, they demanded the end of a generation of syrian dominance over their tiny, mountainous country. the syrians have since left, but lebanon is perhaps most remarkable for how little else has changed."
"in language redolent of a decade ago, hezbollah, in a rally of tens of thousands of its shiite muslim followers this past week, vowed never to disarm and never to end its struggle against israel. the haggling along sectarian lines has unleashed disenchantment, especially among the hopeful youth who drove the protests in beirut s martyrs square."
"there was certainly little sympathy for syria on downtown streets on tuesday night, as hundreds of protesters chanted anti syrian slogans, waved flags and called for lebanese unity. the demonstrating started in martyrs square, in front of the glass and steel office building of an nahar. there was also a stream of people, young and old, christian and muslim, making a continuous pilgrimage up the hill to the gravesites of mr. hariri and his aides. beneath a white tent and in the shadow of a large mosque that mr. hariri had started, the graves have become a place for many people to reflect on what is occurring lebanon, to pray for an end to it and to cry."
"lebanon s cedar revolutionaries returned to the streets here tuesday, transforming the city center into a swaying sea of red and white national flags as the country marked the anniversary of the assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri. the rally, which drew as many as 1 million, echoed last spring s huge anti syrian protests spurred by mr. hariri s murder that compelled damascus to withdraw its troops from lebanon. the syrian disengagement was supposed to usher in a new era of independence from damascus s embrace."
"roiled by weeks of fear and anger, beirut erupted into enraged demonstrations and rioting on sunday at the news that israeli bombs had cut short so many lives in qana. as the televised images of children s bodies were played and replayed on news stations, dozens of young men crashed into the sleek united nations building early sunday, lashing out at an accessible symbol of international inaction. the men broke windows and ransacked some floors of the building, burning an american flag and raising a hezbollah flag in its place. riot police officers and lebanese army troops soon circled the area. but soon crowds converged on the central riad al solh square, and by noon there were thousands."
"prime minister tony blair of britain dodged raucous demonstrators and endured a series of diplomatic snubs on his first official visit to this country, offering help for the lebanese army and vowing to renew efforts to bring peace to the middle east. his message was largely lost on a population angry at his failure to demand an earlier end to the fighting, which had killed nearly 1,200 lebanese, an overwhelming majority of them civilians. hundreds of people gathered to protest near martyrs square on the edge of downtown beirut, which for mr. blair s visit was cordoned off with barbed wire and guarded by hundreds of lebanese troops with tanks. blair, bow your head before the children you have murdered, read one of the placards in the crowd."
"hezbollah held a massive victory rally in southern beirut yesterday, drawing more than 500,000 people in a display of strength aimed at domestic and foreign critics who want to see the disarming of the iran backed shia group... although the rally was a huge demonstration of shia power, other sects were represented, including christian supporters of michel aoun, a former lebanese army general who forged an alliance with hezbollah earlier in the year. hezbollah s claim of victory against israel sits uncomfortably with many other lebanese who regard the death toll of more than 1,000 civilians and 3.6 billion 1.9 billion in damage as a national disaster."
"with an anti syria fury that recalled the aftermath of the assassination of the former prime minister rafik hariri, hundreds of thousands of people poured into this capital on thursday for the funeral of the government minister slain tuesday, pierre gemayel. mourning gave way to calls for unity, defiance and confrontation. demonstrators in the crowd shouted for the resignation of the lebanese president, emile lahoud, who is allied with syria. they cursed the syrian president, bashar al assad, and the hezbollah leader, hassan nasrallah, and spat on pictures of gen. michel aoun, a christian who has aligned his party with hezbollah."
this turned into the tent city that lasted into may 2008
"hezbollah and its allies widened their campaign tuesday to force the lebanese government s resignation, backing what they vowed would be a series of daily protests scattered across the capital. tuesday s gathering of hundreds of flag waving protesters outside a finance ministry office was a sedate affair compared with the convergence of hundreds of thousands twice last month in beirut s downtown, where demonstrators continue a round the clock vigil in hundreds of tents near the barricaded government headquarters. the demonstration was more symbolic than dramatic, marking the beginning of what officials of the shiite muslim group and its leftist and christian allies have long warned is a second stage of their efforts to form a new government and convene early parliamentary elections."
"thousands of supporters of the iranian backed hezbollah, which is seeking to bring down the pro western government, clashed with government supporters and blocked highways leading into beirut, the capital, on tuesday, raising fears that the political crisis might lead to open sectarian conflict. the police said at least three people died and 100 more were wounded throughout the country in the violence, the worst since hezbollah began demanding more political power late last year. mobs of men burned tires, set cars on fire and fought occasional gun battles with their political opponents."

"rival visions for lebanon were on stark display here thursday as partisans from competing political camps gathered to honor their respective slain leaders... in downtown beirut, tens of thousands of lebanese braved the icy rain to gather in martyrs square to remember rafik hariri, the billionaire former prime minister who died three years ago to the day in a massive truck bomb blast, an assassination that his supporters blame on syria. a slew of top anti syrian legislators delivered fiery speeches demanding the election of a new president and charged syria with meddling in lebanese affairs."
rival demonstration
"supporters of the iranian backed group hezbollah, trying to enforce a general strike called by labor unions, clashed with government supporters and blocked roads in beirut on wednesday, escalating tensions as the country remained mired in its worst political crisis since the 1975 1990 civil war. hezbollah mobs blocked roads with burning tires and garbage cans, and set cars on fire to enforce a strike protesting government economic policies and demanding higher minimum wages. they fought occasional gun battles with political opponents."

"originally coded as 6th protest. there was a friday protest on february 11th but not enough information to code. it is mentioned in follow up articles as weekly friday protests, but not enough information about the number of people, the location, the demands or any other information."
article notes that there have been protests on friday for 8 weeks. not enough information to code one of the friday protests. government seems to be making accommodations but no mention of them for this protest.
"in what has become something of a weekly appointment for displaying disaffection with unresponsive governments, thousands of people poured into the streets across the arab world to protest after noon prayers on friday... thousands of jordanians left noon prayers to join in peaceful protests in amman, as the opposition continued to up its demands for political reform. the muslim brotherhood, which organized the protest, said that 15,000 people had participated, but the police put the number at 5,000. the opposition began weeks ago by calling for modest changes to the country s electoral law and a reshuffling of the cabinet, but their demands have increased recently, and there are now growing calls for more fundamental constitutional reform that would limit the powers of king abdullah ii."
"hundreds of journalists demanded an end to government restrictions on the media, reuters reported. journalists from mainstream daily newspapers, news web sites, and state television and radio rallied in a square in amman, the capital."
protesters camped out. government responded with force on saturday. one source says the protests were non violent but another indicated that rocks were thrown and these were the most violent yet.
"hundreds of demonstrators calling for reform rallied late into the evening in the jordanian capital on friday, a week after riot police officers and government supporters violently broke up a rally and a protest camp, leaving one man dead and scores injured. this friday s demonstration, by contrast, went on for hours without intervention. the reformists stayed at their new location, the downtown municipality square, from after noon prayers until 10 p.m. the protesters hailed mostly from the muslim brotherhood and the march 24 movement, a new organization that had originally planned to camp out from that date until their demands for reform were met, like those who took up temporary residency in tahrir square in cairo. but the camp was destroyed a day after it was set up."
"more than 2,000 people took to the streets throughout the country to press their demands for a greater political voice, the a.p. reported, with about half that number demonstrating outside the municipal building in amman, the capital. in the town of zarqa, antigovernment protesters from an extremist islamic faction beat supporters of king abdullah ii with clubs and fists."
articles in recent weeks have talked about continued protests in jordan but there hasn t been enough information to code anything since april. this is correcting an incorrect date
not clear how many people in protest. demonstrations are said to continue but less and less information available.
talks about how the protests in jordan have lessened despite a promising start.
not many protests this year. some articles describe demonstrations vaguely but not enough information to code.
"king abdullah ii of jordan moved quickly to block a recent increase in fuel prices after angry protesters took to the streets over the weekend, raising the specter of renewed social and political unrest in the cash poor kingdom. already shaken by protests inspired by other revolts in the region, jordan, a country of six million, is now contending with an influx of refugees from syria, putting further strain on the country s finances and stability. the jordanian government had mandated a 10 percent increase in the price of 90 octane gasoline and diesel fuel as part of an effort to reduce the subsidy burden on the state budget, in line with international monetary fund recommendations. the increase went into effect on saturday. by saturday night, about 600 people, led by the muslim brotherhood, were demonstrating here in the capital. about 3,000 people staged demonstrations in irbid, a large city north of amman, and protests took place to the south in the cities of maan and karak. some of the demonstrators displayed strong antigovernment slogans."
talks about media protest as well but not enough information to code
"thousands of people marched on friday in the largest demonstration since protests erupted last year, calling on king abdullah ii to accelerate democratic change. the rally was called by the muslim brotherhood, the largest opposition party, which is pushing for broader representation and a more democratic parliament. at least 15,000 protesters flocked to amman, the capital, a day after the king dissolved parliament, setting the stage for new elections. but brotherhood leaders said they would boycott any vote held under the current electoral laws that curb their party s influence."
not clear how many protesters but the first article tells us there were over 100 demonstrations nationally. protests continued for four days.
date is a little unclear
says that protests occurred in other rural areas as well though not clear where or how many people
"hundreds of jordanian islamists, youth activists and other opposition groups rallied friday in amman, calling for a boycott of next week s parliamentary elections. the demonstration came just five days before the vote, which will for the first time see a prime minister emerge from among the winning candidates rather than by appointment by the king. king abdullah ii has said the elections cap two years of reforms he initiated to stave off arab spring type protests that have toppled four longtime rulers in the region. friday s peaceful demonstration drew about 1,300 muslim brotherhood members and others united in the boycott campaign and in demands that the king cede some of his powers and give parliament more say."
talks of continuing protests over the past two years.
"the saudi authorities have cracked down on militant muslims, arresting an undetermined number in a series of confrontations that began three weeks ago when muslim leaders forced the government to boycott the united nations conference on population and development in cairo. last week, militants staged demonstrations demanding the release of jailed islamic leaders, but foreign diplomats and islamic militants provided conflicting reports on the number of people involved, and the saudi government has been reticent. foreign diplomats in riyadh and saudis close to the government played down the crackdown but confirmed that some 500 militants had occupied the governor s quarters in buraida, about 200 miles northwest of riyadh, until they were evicted by the saudi national guard last week."
related to iraq war; not terribly confident on this
"the police blocked roads in riyadh and other cities to thwart demonstrations for political reforms called by an exiled dissident group, witnesses said. al arabiya satellite television quoted a security official as saying 30 people had been arrested in jidda, 31 in dhammam and 13 in hail. it was the second time in two weeks that the exile group, saad al fagih, based in london, had called for protests via a web site and radio."

"a london based dissident, saad al fagih, called for the dec. 16 demonstrations, which advocated replacing the royal family with an elected leadership, an independent judiciary and a new constitution guided by islamic law. less than a few hundred people took part in the demonstrations, said mr. batarfi, who witnessed the protests in jidda. heavy security on the day of the planned protest especially in the capital, riyadh helped thin the number of demonstrators, organizers say."
hunger strike
"eyewitnesses have reported that saudi police fired rubber bullets yesterday, monday, to disperse demonstrators protesting the israeli attack on gaza and around eight persons were injured but a government official denied the report. local citizens said between 200 and 300 persons took part in the procession that was organized in the oil producing eastern province and many of the demonstrators carried photos of palestinians wounded in the israeli attacks on the gaza strip... on his part, saudi preacher and cleric shaykh salman al awdah appealed to the leaders and kings of the arab and islamic countries, in particular saudi king abdallah bin abd al aziz and egyptian president husni mubarak, to stand sternly and strongly against israel and lift the blockade off gaza."
this is the second correction form.
first article notes that police opened fire on 200 protesters on thursday. second article notes that there were arrests at protests on thursday. a little ambiguous from the articles but enough to code. third article gives enough information to code and makes the date clearer. this is a correction form. latest one. source says that although protests were peaceful one interior minister alleged the protesters were violent first. coded as peaceful protest.

electoral rules
protesters called for the ousting of the president but also seem to be demanding political reforms.

"also notes that there was a friday protest of 1,000 in zinjibar but its not clear which friday. police fired live ammunition. article notes that ? thousands of secessionists protested in yemen? ?"
there were sit ins at sanaa university and articles talk about recurring protests that continued for at least 7 days. overnight protests broke out in taiz on the 16th and protests have also spread to aden. information about the protests in taiz and aden is much more vague than in sanaa. protests may have lasted longer but reporting only covers up to the 18th.
"protests may be ongoing but this protest seems much larger than those before it. police also opened fire on protesters and there were deaths. whether this is part of an ongoing protest of a week or the week of protests is unclear. 50,000 protesters came out in taiz and 1,000 in sanaa, and it is unclear how many came out in aden."

"three military personnel were killed and at least 60 people wounded in confrontations around yemen on monday between security forces and protesters, and attackers reportedly stabbed a provincial governor in the neck with a dagger. a month of protests set in motion by the tumult sweeping the arab world appears to be spiraling out of control in yemen, already one of the most impoverished and volatile corners of the arab world, where president ali abdullah saleh has ruled for 32 years."
hundreds protested in hodeidah. protests also took place in 14 of the 21 provinces across yemen.
article notes that sit ins have occurred in at least three places in yemen. also notes that most of the violence has taken place in aden.
pro government supporters opened fire on demonstrators in sanaa and police were noticeably absent.
timeline for these protests is a little troublesome. protests occur daily.
"after numerous deaths in friday s protests, some of the military defected to join protesters."
"as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators for and against president ali abdullah saleh poured into the streets here in the capital for competing rallies on friday, the yemeni leader said he was ready to yield power if he could hand it over to safe hands. his comments, to a rally of about 100,000 supporters in the center of sana, hewed to his earlier promises to relinquish power conditionally and not immediately, terms the protesters demanding his ouster have rejected."
protests seems to continue daily though not enough information to code them.
"police opened fire on protesters in taiz. protests continued in sanaa, al hudaydah and other parts of yemen."
largest protests took place in sanaa and taiz though other protests occurred throughout the country.
this protest was likely much larger than 100s of people.
protests against the mediation plan for saleh to step down and receive immunity from prosecution.
there was a protest in aden though it is not clear how large. police fired on protesters and at least one person was killed.

article notes that this was the largest march outside the demonstration area in the capital. this protest might have been in the 100000s as
updated coding form including the city of taiz
poverty listed as a grievance in this protest though most of the previous articles have talked about corruption and calls for democracy.
note that protests seem to have continued daily and the sit in in sanaa has continued for weeks.
"note this is a correction form. protests broke out in sanaa, taiz, hodeida, as well as other parts of the country. police fired on protesters and at least ten were killed."
"protests have continued in the country though there is not enough information to code these protests. two protesters were killed over the weekend in taiz, in the southwestern highlands, and in hodeidah."
"at least 13 people were killed and scores were wounded in the yemeni capital wednesday when security forces and plainclothes government loyalists opened fire on more than 1,000 anti government demonstrators, medical officials and witnesses said."
tent cities have been set up in cities across yemen. the tent cities in sanaa continue to grow as police have failed to remove protesters.
"government sent in jets to attack the nahm as 10,000s protested peacefully. it appears as if the protests were in sanaa."
government set tents on fire with molotav cocktails. tents had been set up in taiz for three months. information about the encampments in taiz and sanaa has been scarce and somewhat inconsistent.
"it is getting hard to distinguish between protests and rebellion. on the 6th of june there were mass celebrations as saleh left the country because of injuries. however, this was not coded as a protest since articles describe it more as a celebration. article talks about the demans echoing across the country on friday suggesting that protests were national in nature. article also notes that the tents in sanaa are still standing."
"protests occurred in sanaa, taiz, hadramawt, among other areas."
"tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets across yemen on sunday, demanding that a transitional presidential council be created to replace embattled president ali abdullah saleh and that his sons and relatives leave the country."
"even as antigovernment protesters in yemen struggled to revitalize their movement, sketching somewhat shaky plans over the weekend for a transitional government, they produced a show of their core strength, taking to the streets in huge numbers on sunday to protest the rule of president ali abdullah saleh. it was the 33rd anniversary of mr. saleh s rule, dubbed a day of rage by the protesters, tens of thousands of whom turned out across the country. but despite their numbers, any advance in their position seemed tenuous, and the country remained deadlocked and leaderless."
"not clear how many people were protesting but given the size of other protests in sanaa 10,000s seems appropriate."
"protests held in sanaa, taiz, hudaydah, mukalla among other places."
tents are still set up in sanaa.
"firing from rooftops and from the back of pickup trucks, security forces turned heavy caliber machine guns and other weapons on demonstrators here on sunday, setting off battles between army defectors and forces loyal to the government in the worst day of violence in the capital since march. the violence left at least 24 demonstrators dead and more than 200 wounded in the yemeni capital and threatened to scuttle any hopes for an accord between president ali abdullah saleh and his opponents, who have been locked in a standoff for months over demands that he step down and transfer power. the fighting also raised the prospect of open and more intense sparring among factions of yemen s divided military, which many here fear could lead to civil war."
protesters separate from the tent sit in at the university were shot and killed by the state.
"president ali abdullah saleh said thursday that he would not step down while his strongest rivals remained in power. mr. saleh, right, told the washington post and time magazine that his main opponents, a general who defected and a rival clan, would have to be removed for any political transition to go through. he also procured a decree from a government financed committee of yemeni religious scholars declaring that it is sinful to protest against the state and that security forces are fighting for the sake of god. what happens at demonstrations and sit ins in residential areas and public roads is ungodly, reads the decree, or fatwa. mr. saleh, who recently returned to yemen after nearly four months of medical treatment in saudi arabia, has used such fatwas for political benefit in the past."
government fired on protesters marching in sanaa separate form the sit in.
"not clear how large this protest was, but it appears to be the same size at the protest the day before which had 1000s of people. this protest was distinct from sit in."
"yemeni government forces opened fire tuesday on protesters in sanaa, killing seven, a medical official said, a day after the capital witnessed its worst fighting in weeks. mohammed al qubati, the director of a field hospital at the main protest site in sanaa, dubbed change square, said dozens more were injured in the tuesday demonstrations demanding the resignation of president ali abdullah saleh. tens of thousands of protesters marched through the city, led by shirtless young men with the words leave . . . you butcher, a reference to saleh, scrawled across their chests."
not clear how large this protest was.
this is a correction where sanaa was added to the location of the protest. protests seem to occur very often though the coverage of them has gotten more sporadic as fighting intensifies in yemen.
not clear what the government response to this protest was. protests continue throughout the country.
"government soldiers opened fire on a giant demonstration in yemen s capital on saturday, killing at least nine protesters in the worst violence since president ali abdullah saleh agreed to give up his post more than a month ago. the march, which activists said was peaceful, was to protest a deal granting mr. saleh immunity from prosecution for the killing of protesters. hours after saturday s killings, mr. saleh, who retains his title and much of his power until a new election in february, announced that he would soon be leaving for the united states. the announcement seemed intended to defuse anger at the violence by his forces as well as pressure from some of his political rivals and foreign allies, who fear that mr. saleh has no intention of fading from the scene."
"not clear what date this protest occurred, but it was likely friday a popular day for protest. article says people protested across the country with thousands being attacked by police."
protesters came out in 18 provinces to protest on the one year anniversary of a bloody crackdown on protesters.
note that as of the end of august protesters still occupy a university in sanaa which is coded as an ongoing protest that started in february of 2011.
date of this protest is unclear. friday is a popular day of protest so this is coded as a friday protest.
hundreds protested in the town of radaa calling on the government to intervene in u.s. drone strikes. since protesters were calling for the government to address these drone strikes this is a code able protest.
"a protest for succession occurred in aden. it seems as if the protest was peaceful, but the southern movement was violent and attacked security forces. not clear how many people were protesting but given the size of past protests and the state response 1000s seems reasonable. also note that according to a february 19th article the sit in at change square that began in february 2011 has continued."
"as hundreds of yemenis marched to the ministry of electricity on june 5 to protest the power cuts, their anger was focused on politicians in sanaa. the largely middle class demonstrators formed only a modest crowd, but their protest was the clearest manifestation yet of declining faith in the yemeni government s inability to rule, illustrated by its failure to stop the power cuts."
"opposition groups attacked kuwait s increasingly ineffective government today at an outdoor rally and other gatherings that defied martial law. an islamic fundamentalist group joined the opposition, demanding a new coalition government. and for the first time since the country became independent in 1962, an opposition group demanded publicly that the crown prince leave the government. sheiks and islamic clerics criticized the government in a series of speeches for the disgraceful and shameful way it is running our country, as one speaker put it. this is an unprecedented demonstration, a western diplomat said as he watched about 1,000 people, mostly sunni muslims, gather near government headquarters at bayan palace."
"more than a thousand kuwaitis of varied political persuasions rallied tonight to grumble that emir jaber al ahmed al sabah s promise of parliamentary elections in the coming year, god willing fell short of their post war demands for increased democracy. we must have democracy right from the beginning, that is the correct way, said one of the rally s organizers, ahmed bakr, a soft spoken pharmacist who was elected in 1985 to the parliament that the emir dissolved the next year."
"in the first public protest since the persian gulf war, about 1,000 kuwaitis gathered at a mosque tonight to call for faster democratic changes and to reject the government s recent decrees as unconstitutional. the opposition gathering was illegal, but uniformed policemen did not appear, and the government did nothing to interfere with the meeting, which had been advertised by word of mouth."

"protest vote: hundreds of kuwaiti women tried to register their names as voters tuesday. on the first day of a month long period during which voters lists are updated, groups of women arrived to register at 13 precincts, according to gulf news in dubai, united arab emirates. kuwait s 1962 constitution grants equal rights to men and women, but the election law allows only men who are over 21 to vote or run for office. last year, kuwait s parliament voted down a decree that would have granted women the right to vote starting in 2003."
"about 500 kuwaiti women demonstrated outside their parliament yesterday in the latest manifestation of the grassroots drive across the arab world for greater freedom and democracy. they chanted women s rights now and carried placards. one, written in arabic, read: our democracy will only be complete with women. another, in english, read: we are not less, you are not more. we need a balance, open the door."

location is unclear but article says all oil was prevented from entering or leaving so i coded this as national. also not clear what the government response was or whether the strike lasted for more than one day. the strike was coded as a one day strike. previous articles have noted that thousands of public employees have been on strike but there is not enough information to code that.
second article notes that there were thousands of protesters.
"hundreds of kuwaiti citizens gathered in al erada square monday evening in protest of the cabinet s appeal on the constitutionality of election law articles, which they believe is an attempt to monopolize the distribution of electoral constituencies and go against the will of the people. the people are the sovereign gathering, invited by youth activist group nahaj , drew a large crowd, comprised of opposition youth, activists and lawmakers of the reinstated 2009 assembly and annulled 2012 assembly."

"opposition lawmakers, activists and their supporters gathered in al erada square on monday for the third time to denounce plans to revise the country s electoral constituencies before the next parliament elections. a large number, headed by mp waleed al tabtabaei, proceeded to march towards the palace of justice, holding placards and chanting leave jaber, leave and national unity with popular government , but were halted at the national assembly by security forces and were compelled to return to the square. earlier, al tabtabaei said that a march towards the palace of justice will be announced following an overnight sit in at the square. in all cases, we will not clash with the police, he stated. however, extensive security forces, including riot police with batons, were present near the square and had erected barriers around the area to prevent any marches. over 3,000 citizens gathered at al erada and opposition representatives called on the constitutional court to heed the will of the people."

"police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse at least 50 protesters near a mosque yesterday. the clashes erupted when the young protesters tried to gather inside the mosque about three miles west of manama, the capital. the authorities had sealed off the mosque after the friday noon prayers were held without incident. bahrain, like several other arab muslim states, insists that mosques only be used for prayer and not for airing political views."
"shiite muslim youths clashed yesterday with security forces in a village four miles from the capital, manama, after police sealed off a mosque that had been the focus of anti government shiite protests. earlier, bahraini officials said they had defused several percussion bombs planted thursday by foreign backed protesters whom they accused of a sabotage plot. the government said an undisclosed number of people had been arrested. an interior ministry statement said a number of acts of sabotage and violence occurred thursday at several villages and accused protesters of holding illegal demonstrations, starting 38 fires and attacking policemen, private and public property."

"tens of thousands marched outside the capital, manama, in one of bahrain s largest opposition demonstrations to demand democratic reforms. the peaceful march, called by the shiite led opposition, follows unsuccessful talks with the government on constitutional changes to give greater powers to parliament s elected assembly, which is on an equal footing with a government appointed chamber. the government, a constitutional monarchy, has introduced some reforms, but the country s majority shiites want more rights in the small sunni ruled gulf state."
"at least 15 bahrainis were hospitalized in the capital, manama, after police officers beat them before they could stage a demonstration about unemployment, witnesses said. they said baton wielding police officers hit dozens of people who had planned to pelt the parliament building with eggs and tomatoes to show their disappointment over the way the government was dealing with unemployment in bahrain. the police chief, eissa abdullah al muslim, said security forces had to break up the crowd because people did not heed their order to disperse. bahrain has said it would begin an 80 million a year training program next year to help tackle unemployment, which economists put at 20 percent."

"protesters went home monday but returned tuesday and set up tents. protests continued until thursday morning when police violently dispersed protesters. but protests continued and the square was reoccupied on saturday. some protests had over 100,000 people. articles talk about encampments and continued protests making it clear that this is a continued protest similar to those in other arab spring countries. articles talk about weeks of protests. march 7th article talks about 3 weeks of daily protests. march 16th martial law declared after a month of protests and a few days earlier troops from saudi arabia also arrived to help quell protests. march 17th article the government violently disperses protests and this is coded as the end of this protest."

although led by foreigners the protest was attended by women in the country. note that the second protest takes place later the same day though the demands are different.
note that this protest occurred on the same day as 150 women protested for a different cause. also note that there were protests throughout the year. protests occurred on february 13th and 14th though there was not enough information to code. protests are said to occur frequently.

"a bahrain court on tuesday upheld jail terms for 20 opposition figures convicted of plotting to overthrow the western allied government, including eight activists given life in prison. the decision is likely to deepen the nearly 19 month crisis between bahrain s sunni rulers and shiite led protesters seeking a greater political voice in the persian gulf kingdom, which is home to the u.s. navy s 5th fleet. those on trial included prominent protest leaders: among the eight given life was abdulhadial khawaja, who staged a 110 day hunger strike this year. the 12 others face terms ranging from five to 15 years; seven of them were convicted in absentia. hours later, riot police outside the capital, manama, fired tear gas at hundreds of protesters as some of them threw firebombs."
two days of protests to mark the anniversary of protests from two years prior. not clear if the protest continued after the second day. one killed as police shot into the crowds.

"according to agency reports, police and pro democracy protesters started clashing late on saturday night with chants of race of blood . their stones and eggs were met with teargas and stun grenades. there were also claims that police used birdshot, causing several injuries. hundreds of shia demonstrators attempted to reach manama s pearl square, the focus of bahrain s arab spring two years ago, but police repelled them with teargas, while protesters retaliated with petrol bombs."
"bahraini protesters clashed with police saturday, a day ahead of a formula one race that the island kingdom s opposition hopes will draw attention to its campaign for democracy. young men blocked roads, burned tires and threw rocks at security forces who fired tear gas in several villages around the capital, manama, on saturday afternoon and evening after similar clashes on friday, human rights activists and witnesses said. such skirmishes have occurred almost nightly in bahrain for the past two years, and the opposition has called for more protests in the run up to the grand prix, which many in the shiite majority country accuse the sunni led government of using to disguise political dysfunction and human rights abuses."
"the way the plan was originally conceived, six boats loaded with anti globalization activists were to sail into the port of this persian gulf sheikdom to protest the world trade organization meeting here. we were organizing everybody in our movement, said jose bove, the french farmer renowned for vandalizing a mcdonald s restaurant. the scheme was scrapped, however, after the sept. 11 terrorist attacks. bove, one of a few dozen activists roaming the halls at the conference center where the wto meeting is being held through tuesday, instead has joined in staging occasional demonstrations."
"when 800 distraught workers made a protest march down a main highway here last week, they set off a national debate about the treatment of the foreign workers turning this persian gulf emirate from desert dunes into a modern metropolis. the men were among 6,000 foreign laborers, most of them indians and pakistanis, who live in a desert work camp several miles outside of the city. all 6,000 had languished without pay for more than five months. the protest was by no means the first of its kind here, but it was unprecedented in its scale and high profile, laying bare a dickensian underworld of poverty and exploitation in the shadow of a gleaming city of high rise buildings and luxury hotels."
"when hundreds of workers angered by low salaries and mistreatment rioted tuesday night at the site of what is to become the world s tallest skyscraper, not only were they expressing the growing frustration of asian migrants here, they offered a glimpse of an increasingly organized labor force. far from the high rise towers and luxury hotels emblematic of dubai, the workers turning this swath of desert into a modern metropolis live in a dickensian world of cramped labor camps, low pay and increasing desperation."
"but a new grievance is galvanising the thousands of foreign workers who supply virtually all of the manual labour behind the united arab emirates massive building boom. in the past week the falling dollar and a steadily rising cost of living have prompted a series of violent strikes by workers, whose demand is simple: they want more pay. i no longer have enough money to send home to my family. my expenses are too great, mr khan, 33, a crane operator from haripur, pakistan, said."

protests become broadly political by this point
"yesterday brought momentous and awe inspiring news from one of the world s most oppressed nations. defying their military government, tens of thousands of burmese marched through the center of their largest city, rangoon, as well as in more than two dozen other towns and cities. estimates of the crowd in rangoon ranged from 50,000 to 100,000 by far the largest protest since a student led uprising in 1988. the new movement, led by buddhist monks, has slowly mushroomed from a protest against price increases and police brutality into a full fledged democratic uprising, thanks to the unresponsiveness of the regime and the astonishing courage of the monks."

"burmese monks took to the streets demanding lower prices and the release of political prisoners yesterday, in the first demonstration of its kind since the brutal repression of last month s democracy demonstrations. more than 100 monks marched through the central burmese town of pakkoku in violation of an order outlawing gatherings of more than five people. the demonstration, which appears to have been left alone by the authorities, indicates that last month s crackdown has not quelled the resentment and frustration that brought hundreds of thousands of people on to the streets in september."
